## Overview 

A static site generator implemented in Python. 

## What is a static site generator?

A static site generator constructs static webpages from some input data. This SSG takes markdown files as that input. 

## Usage 

Due to its simplicity, this generator should only be used to create blogs and very basic websites (if that's your jam).
